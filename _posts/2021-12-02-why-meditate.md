Reasons:
1. Increased attention span
2. Increased capacity to go through difficult times without collapsing
3. Increased awareness of the behaviors of the mind
4. Increased compassion for all living beings


A note for people who are struggling to meditate consistently: 
+ There is no need to struggle, your development will take as long as it takes.
+ You may find yourself becoming imbalanced (drowsy, angry, overly-excited, etc) when exposed to experiences which can help you grow. The ability to recognize this and consciously respond is a priceless skill that anyone can develop and improve through sustained effort.
+ The progress of your meditation practice will change your life, and make you more aware of change.
